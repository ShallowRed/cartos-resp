# Cartos RESP 2025 - Architecture Overview

> **Entry Point**: Start here for system understanding. This document provides high-level overview and dispatches to detailed domain documentation.

## Documentation Structure

**Domain-Specific Documentation:**
- `vue-architecture.llm.txt` - Vue.js components, state management, and UI patterns
- `services.llm.txt` - Service registry, MapService architecture, and renderers  
- `data-architecture.llm.txt` - Data sources, processing pipeline, and reactive flow

## System Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vue.js 3 with Composition API
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.9
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI 5 components
- **State Management**: Pinia stores
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js and Observable Plot for map rendering
- **Geographic Data**: Natural Earth data with TopoJSON format

### Application Structure

#### Generic Map System
The application uses a registry-based architecture for handling multiple map types through a unified interface.

> **Detailed Coverage**: See `services.llm.txt` for complete service architecture, registry patterns, and renderer implementations.

**Core Components:**
- Map Registry: Centralizes service registration and discovery
- MapService Base Class: Handles data loading and filtering logic
- Service Implementations: couverture and duree services with specific renderers

#### State Management Architecture

> **Detailed Coverage**: See `vue-architecture.llm.txt` for complete Vue.js patterns, component hierarchy, and Pinia store integration.

**Central Store Pattern:**
- Pinia-based map store manages global application state
- Reactive selectedEntries trigger automatic map re-rendering
- Async loading states with error handling
- Computed properties provide derived data to components

#### Map Service Architecture

> **Detailed Coverage**: See `services.llm.txt` for MapService class design, service implementations, and renderer architecture.

**Service Pattern:**
- Abstract MapService base class with common functionality
- Service-specific implementations (couverture, duree)
- Registry-based service discovery and management

#### Component Architecture

> **Detailed Coverage**: See `vue-architecture.llm.txt` for component hierarchy, props/events, and UI patterns.

**Component Structure:**
- App.vue: Root container with service initialization
- MapSelector: Map type switching interface
- SelectInput: Generic selection controls  
- MapRenderer: Observable Plot visualization container

#### Data Processing Pipeline

> **Detailed Coverage**: See `data-architecture.llm.txt` for data sources, processing pipeline, normalization, and reactive data flow.

**Data Flow:**
- Geographic data loading via Natural Earth TopoJSON
- CSV data processing with D3 parsing
- Reactive filtering based on user selections
- Observable Plot rendering with customizable visualizations

### Reactive Architecture

> **Cross-References**: 
> - `vue-architecture.llm.txt` - Vue reactivity patterns and store integration
> - `data-architecture.llm.txt` - Reactive data flow and processing chain
> - `services.llm.txt` - Service state management and filtering

**Reactive Flow:**
- Vue 3 reactivity system with Pinia stores
- Automatic UI updates on user interactions
- Computed properties trigger map re-rendering
- Error states and loading feedback
