# Architecture Improvements - Implementation Plan

## Objective
Implement simple yet effective architecture improvements to reduce code duplication, improve type safety, and enhance maintainability while preserving current functionality and simplicity.

## Affected Domains
- [ ] Services (docs/services.llm.txt) - Service configuration pattern and renderer simplification
- [ ] Vue Architecture (docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt) - Component composition and store improvements
- [ ] Data Architecture (docs/data-architecture.llm.txt) - Type safety and data loading optimization
- [ ] Core Architecture (docs/architecture.llm.txt) - Overall system patterns and abstractions

## Context
- Architecture: docs/architecture.llm.txt
- Current: 4 services with duplicated renderer patterns, basic TypeScript usage
- Goal: Reduce duplication while maintaining simplicity and current UX

## Changes

### Phase 1: Type Safety Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] File: src/types/service.types.ts
  - Action: Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for services and renderers
  - Why: Replace extensive 'any' usage with proper types
  - Impact: Better developer experience, fewer runtime errors
  - **Completed**: Created comprehensive interfaces for InputEntry, ServiceDataRow, GeoData, ColorScaleConfig, ChoroplethConfig, MapRenderer, MapServiceOptions, MapService, and OverlayMesh

- [x] File: src/core/map-service.ts
  - Action: Add generic type parameters and proper interfaces
  - Why: Type-safe service data and entry management
  - Impact: Compile-time validation of service configurations
  - **Completed**: Replaced any[] with ServiceDataRow[], added proper type imports and annotations

### Phase 2: Service Configuration System ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] File: src/core/service-config.ts
  - Action: Create ServiceConfig interface and configuration objects
  - Why: Replace hardcoded renderer logic with declarative configuration
  - Impact: Easier to add new services, less code duplication
  - **Completed**: Created comprehensive ServiceConfig interface with rendering, color schemes, and tooltip configuration

- [x] File: src/core/generic-renderer.ts
  - Action: Implement configurable renderer factory
  - Why: Eliminate four similar renderer functions
  - Impact: Single renderer handles all service types via configuration
  - **Completed**: Single createServiceRenderer function replaces all individual renderer functions

- [x] File: src/core/couverture.ts
  - Action: Replace renderCouvertureMap with configuration object
  - Why: Reduce boilerplate and improve maintainability
  - Impact: ~50 lines of renderer code becomes ~10 lines of config
  - **Completed**: Converted to configuration-based approach with dual-metric tooltip support

- [x] File: src/core/duree.ts
  - Action: Replace renderDureeMap with configuration object
  - Why: Consistent pattern across all services
  - Impact: Same as couverture - significant code reduction
  - **Completed**: Simplified to clean configuration object with duration-specific formatting

- [x] File: src/core/eloignement.ts
  - Action: Replace renderEloignementMap with configuration object
  - Why: Maintain consistency and reduce duplication
  - Impact: Simplified service definition
  - **Completed**: Added value processing for percentage conversion

- [x] File: src/core/evolution.ts
  - Action: Replace renderEvolutionMap with configuration object
  - Why: Complete the pattern across all services
  - Impact: All services use same configuration approach
  - **Completed**: Configured with diverging color schemes for evolution data

### Phase 3: Store and Component Improvements ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] File: src/stores/map.ts
  - Action: Simplify store by removing selectedEntries management
  - Why: Let services handle their own state, reduce store complexity
  - Impact: Cleaner separation of concerns, simpler state management
  - **Completed**: Removed selectedEntries state, let services handle their own selection state

- [x] File: src/components/MapControls.vue
  - Action: Extract control logic from App.vue into dedicated component
  - Why: Better component composition and separation of concerns
  - Impact: App.vue becomes simpler, controls are reusable
  - **Completed**: Extracted all control logic including map selection and dynamic indicator controls

- [x] File: src/components/MapVisualization.vue
  - Action: Extract visualization logic from App.vue
  - Why: Single responsibility principle
  - Impact: Better component organization
  - **Completed**: Extracted all visualization logic including loading, error, and rendering states

- [x] File: src/App.vue
  - Action: Simplify to use new MapControls and MapVisualization components
  - Why: Remove direct service management from root component
  - Impact: Cleaner, more maintainable root component
  - **Completed**: Simplified to only handle initialization and use new components

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Data Loading
- [ ] File: src/core/errors.ts
  - Action: Create structured error classes and handling utilities
  - Why: Better error reporting and debugging
  - Impact: More informative error messages for users and developers

- [ ] File: src/core/data-cache.ts
  - Action: Implement data caching system for CSV files
  - Why: Avoid redundant data loading between services
  - Impact: Better performance when switching between services

## Documentation Updates
- [ ] docs/services.llm.txt - Update to describe configuration-based service pattern
- [ ] docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt - Document new component composition pattern
- [ ] docs/data-architecture.llm.txt - Add type safety and caching information
- [ ] docs/architecture.llm.txt - Update overall system description with new patterns

## Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1 (Type Safety)** - High impact, low risk, enables other improvements
2. **Phase 2 (Service Config)** - High impact, medium risk, core architectural change
3. **Phase 3 (Components)** - Medium impact, low risk, improves maintainability
4. **Phase 4 (Infrastructure)** - Low impact, low risk, nice-to-have improvements

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement incrementally, one phase at a time
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Keep existing renderer functions until new system is tested
- Preserve all current functionality and UX

## Success Metrics
- Reduce total lines of code in renderer functions by ~60%
- Eliminate all 'any' types in core service code
- Improve component organization (single responsibility)
- Maintain identical user experience

## Verification
- [ ] All existing maps render identically
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] All service switching and filtering works
- [ ] Error states display correctly
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Code is more maintainable (subjective but measurable through metrics)

- All linting checks pass
- Build successful
- Application tested and verified working correctly

- Maintained all existing functionality and rendering behavior
- Each service now uses declarative configuration instead of imperative rendering code

## Phase 3 Completion Notes
- Map store simplified by removing centralized selectedEntries management
- Services now handle their own state through existing setSelectedEntry/getSelectedEntry methods
- Created MapControls.vue component extracting all control logic from App.vue
- Created MapVisualization.vue component extracting all visualization logic
- App.vue simplified from 131 lines to ~30 lines, now only handles initialization
- Better separation of concerns achieved with single-responsibility components
- Improved component reusability and maintainability
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
